# The-Red-Circled-Menace
A personal project I made when learning to program in python with the use pf pygame.  Still working on it.

INTRO:
The Red Circled Menace is a simple puzzle game where the player tries to get his or her pieces from their start positions to the end, avoiding and taking out red pieces along the way.  The program uses a 2d array to store strings, and those strings determine where pieces are drawn on the board.

The save feature saves the 2d array of strings as a text file.  The program can read the file both to edit and play.

FEATURES:
Menus
buttons
a few pre-made puzzles
red pieces that (are supposed to) move horizontally or vertically
red pieces that live and die to the rules of Conway's Game Of Life
and a framework for the player to build their own puzzles.
A random puzzle generator
(untested) a setup to eventually replace the drawn geometry with actual graphics

HOPEFUL FEATURES:
A working .exe so it can be played on a computer without python
actual graphics
an end-state
a functional tutoral
an after-game menu
a server setup to upload and download puzzles from the web, and a menu to use it
